### Relational Operators
- comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=)
- Equals (==)
- Not equals (!=)

### Logical Operators

## Conditionals
[Code](day2/conditionals.py)

- Decision making statements in programming languages decide the direction of flow of program execution.

- There comes situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next. 

- Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decision we will execute the next block of code.

- Majorly, the following 3 conditional constructs are used in Python:
    - if
    - else
    - elif

## Loops
- for
- while

## Jump statements
- break
- continue

## Functions

- Calling functions
- Function scope
- Recursive functions
